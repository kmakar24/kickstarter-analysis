# Overview of Project 
* The purpose of this analysis is to take the data Louisa has on the goals of art and theater fundingâ€™s and turn it into useful information that can help her know why her fund raising campaign did not reach its goal. And learn more about the patterns of successful and unsuccessful fundraisings with regards to multiple factors such as launch date and launch goal for the subcategory that related to her and the country.  
# Analysis and Challanges
* By organizing the information and threw different excel formulas we were able to not only make the information more readable and appliable but then go a step farther and turn it into an analysis specific to what Louisa needed. I struggled with creating the year formula. It was hard using a cell that already had a formal in it to convert the time to a readable time.  I was viewing it as black and white, when you had to think outside the box and new you wanted just the information in row S and nothing else. When I did Years=(S) this did not work and would give me the date: 6/22/05 so after doing a lot of googling I realized it was because cell S had a formal so I needed to make it so that it was only applying it to what was in that row in that cell. 
* But I used line graphs because they help track things over a period of time which was one of the main factors we were using to assess the funding goals.
## Results
# Conclusion about Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
* We can conclude that theater Outcomes for fundraising that starts in May-June has a high success rate and there is a huge peak in successful outcomes. We can also conclude that there are a lot more funding that starts in the summer months, and while the number of campaigns that start funding in these months is significantly different than other months the failed amount changes a way smaller amount then the successful. The successful outcomes fluctuates a lot more than the failed.
# Conclusion about Outcomes based on Goals
* There is a high percent of failed projects with goals from 30,000 to 34,999 range. We can also conclude that successful projects do well when they have lower goals. 
# Limitations of this dataset
* There were a lot more pojects that were in the Less than 1,000 and 1,000 to 4,000 range than all the others so I wish it took into consideration the difference in total projects. It also does not make clear why projects are canceleling and I think it would have benefited if we did an analysis on how far along in the project that they cancelled.   
# Other Tables and or Graphs we could have used
* Going off that analysis I think it would have benefited to do a bar graph to show trends and differences in why projects are canceling, why projects are successful and why projects are failing.
